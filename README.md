This workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) will search you snippets from the application [Snippets](http://www.snippetsapp.com/). It's not required to have Snippets running since it will search the data storage (XML file) directly.

## Usage

![](https://github.com/pahen/Snippets.alfredworkflow/raw/master/img/search.png)

```ENTER``` to copy to clipboard.

```CMD + ENTER``` to copy & paste.

```ALT + ENTER``` to view as Large Type.

You can also create a new snippet from a text selection if you open the workflow and assign a hotkey to the "Selection in OS X" trigger.
